# HeadCam
Custom camera for GTA V, inspired by MW2's spectator camera

This script adds an alternative camera view, inspired by MW2 beta spectator headcam. Sadly, due to clipping issues I wasn't able to replicate the camera as is, and if I'll have any success, I'll update it here.
<b>Highly recommend to use the mod with <a href="https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/laser-sight-net">this laser script</a>, for aiming</b>

Features:  
<li>New on foot camera view inspired by call of duty, where the camera is attached to the player (check video) <br />
<li>Compatible with other camera mods, automatically resets the camera if interrupted, after a set amount of time (delay configurable in the ini file)<br />

Two modes: <br /> 
1.Replaces one of the existing camera views  <br />
2.Activates HeadCam while aiming only  <br />

Use .ini to configure  <br />
